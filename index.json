Moreover, the connections between these notions of largeness and van der Waerden's theorem on arithmetic progressions are among some of the earliest results in Ramsey Theory.\n We'll state generalizations for both syndetic and thick subsets and show how these notions of largeness can be \"composed\" to produce different (and possibly new) notions of largeness. (The generalization of syndetic subset that we state is due to Shuungula, Zelenyuk, and Zelenyuk, but this notion has appeared, more or less, implicitly if unnamed in the literature connected to the algebraic structure of $\\beta S$.) Some of these composite notions are well known, such as piecewise syndetic sets. Other composite notions are trivial, reducing to the collection $\\{S\\}$. While a few others appear to be new. We'll sketch a suggestive visualization of these notions, outline the proof of some characterizations of these generalizations, under certain relatively mild conditions, formulate a classification problem, and outline some connections to Ramsey Theory.\n","tags":[],"title":"Composing some notions of largeness and a classification problem for certain structured sets","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Caroline Breitenberger","John H.

The Department of Mathematics is conducting a redesign of ﬁrst-year calculus. This project consists of multiple interventions (sections employing active learning, ﬂipped classroom pilots, open access textbooks) viewed through many lenses (including affective surveys and conceptual pre- and post-tests) and development of a framework for the cohesive interaction of the involved faculty and staff. Data that led to redesign of speciﬁc STEM courses, the status of these course redesign projects, and recent assessment efforts regarding the success of students in the redesigned courses will be discussed.","tags":[],"title":"Using Data in STEM Course Redesign","type":"talk"},{"authors":["John H.

Currently the most powerful formulation of the central sets theorem is due to De, Hindman, and Strauss in [3, Corollary 3.10].
